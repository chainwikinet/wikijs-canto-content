## Decentralized Exchanges

### Canto DEX
Canto has a built-in AMM DEX—a clone of Solidly (verify this!)—with no fees.  More info in the official docs:
- https://docs.canto.io/overview/canto-dex-and-lp-interface

The DEX aggregator Slingshot provides a frontend for trading assets on the Canto DEX:

### Other DEXes on Canto
Other users have said that they're going to launch DEXes on Canto; so far, none have been launched.

### Cosmos
If `$CANTO` was available in another DEX within Cosmos—Osmosis, Crescent, Junoswap, somewhere on Evmos—it would be easier for users with funds already on Cosmos to onboard.  So far, Canto only has IBC connections to Gravity Bridge Chain (gbcETH, gbcUSDC, gbcUSDT) and Cosmos Hub, and neither of these two chains has a DEX.

Watch Discord for discussions on additional IBC links for details.

### Ethereum
If GBC creates an Ethereum ERC-20 representation of `$CANTO`, then it would also be possible to bridge `$CANTO` to Ethereum and create liquidity there on Uniswap &etc.  Watch [the GBC governance page](https://www.mintscan.io/gravity-bridge/proposals) and [GBC forum](https://commonwealth.im/gravity-bridge/) for updates.
