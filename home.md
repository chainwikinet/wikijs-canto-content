# What is Canto?
Canto is an EVM (Ethereum-like) blockchain running as a sovereign Cosmos zone using the Ethermint EVM framework.

Here's how Canto was described by contributors on https://canto.io at launch:
> canto is a layer-1 blockchain built to deliver on the promise of defi. as a post-traditional financial movement, canto enables accessibility, transparency, and freedom for new systems. driven by a loosely organized collective of chain-native builders, canto provides a new commons powered by free public infrastructure

> At launch, Canto provides Tendermint consensus secured by Canto validator nodes and an EVM execution layer via Cosmos SDK in addition to core financial primitives designed to support the Free Public Infrastructure (FPI). These primitives include: 
Canto DEX — a zero-fee DEX for liquidity providers
Canto Lending Market (CLM) — a pooled lending Compound v2 fork
$NOTE — a fully collateralized unit of account token issued by the CLM which also serves the ecosystem as a USDC/USDT soft-pegged stablecoin

Canto had no private or public sale; read more about [the token distribution](/en/distribution).
